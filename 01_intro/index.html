<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : IT Person's Wrist Watch</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Imagine a wrist watch that shows:
 - Wifi Speed
 - Time
 - Weather
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 2: Desktop Sized Robotic Sweeper</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Imagine a little robot controlled by you sweeping all of the dust from your table so cleaning your table becomes a game.

<h4>Idea 3: Desktop Buddy That Shoots Rubber Bands When It's time for you to sleep</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

A lot of people are experiencing problems with maintaining a stable sleep schedule (just like me), do you know what the
solution is ? Meet with SleepyBuddy! SleepyBuddy will be happy to accompany you in your deep work sessions, but when the clock
hits to your desired bed time SleepyBuddy will do anything it can do to get you to your bed. At first it will warn you, but
if you don't take it's warnings seriously, it will shoot you rubber bands until you go to your bed.
